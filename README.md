<h1> How Long To Beat GUI Python Vers. </h1>

<!-- Description -->
<h2> Description </h2>

<!-- 1. Describe the project -->
<p> This project utilizes <a href="https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI"> ScrappyCocco's HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI </a>. How Long to Beat is a website that I mainly use to see how long it takes to beat a game. The website contains information about the average time to beat a game if you are mainly doing the story, story + extra, and even if you want to complete everything the game has to offer. I made a GUI that essentially does the basic functionalities of the website (i.e. just shows the completion times). </p>

<!-- 2. Explain why you made it -->
<p> I made this project in mind of my interests of video games, and my likeness of the How Long to Beat website. I wanted to use my experience of creating python GUIs with my hobby of gaming. </p>

<!-- 3. Describe how this is done -->

<!-- Technologies and Frameworks -->
<h2> Technologies and Frameworks </h2>
<p> Make sure to install the DearPyGUI, HowLongToBeat, and OpenCV Modules for it to work. You can follow the installation to DearPyGUI <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui"> here </a>, HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI <a href="https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI#usage"> here </a>, and OpenCV modules</p> 

<p> Alt: <i> pip install dearpygui </i>, <i> pip install howlongtobeat</i>, and <i> pip install opencv-python</i> </p>

<ul>
    <li><i>PyCharm IDE</i> - Coding Environment </li>
    <li><i>DearPyGUI</i> - Framework used to create the GUI </li>
    <li><i>OpenCV</i> - Used to scale images of the game covers</li>
    <li><i>HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI</i> - Used to search for games and gather specific data on the HowLongToBeat website </li>
    <li><i>Python 3.8</i> - Python vers.</li>
</ul>
  

<!-- How to Setup -->
<h2> How to Setup </h2>
<ol>
    <li> Make sure to install all the necessary frameworks (mentioned at in the Technologies and Frameworks section) </li>
    <li> Launch the main.py, and the GUI should show up </li>
    <li> Search the game you want, and the results should be shown </li>
</ol>

<!-- What I learned -->
<h2> What I learned </h2>
<ul>
    <li>APIs can be made by using Web Scrapers like ScrappyCocco's HowLongToBeat-Python API</li>
    <li>Lambda functions are essentially functions without names </li>
    <li>Lambda functions are instantiate using the Lambda keyword along with parameters, a colon, and the function definition </li>
    <li>Lambda functions help reduce the # of lines of code for better readability </li>
    <li>Lambda is mainly used when the function is specifically used in one or a few instances </li>
</ul>
